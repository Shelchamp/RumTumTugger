# README

Rum Tum Tugger is a full stack application modeled on Tumblr, preserving its layout and cozy ambiance.
While there is no rigid theme for Rum Tum Tugger, the goal of this application is to be a thought journal.
Everyone is invited to sign up anonymously, post art, leave confessions, or simply peruse through Tugger's entries.
Share a painting you've been working on for months, a thought that has been weighing on your mind, or a funny cat picture. Things can be as contemplative or silly you want, as long as you are having fun.
